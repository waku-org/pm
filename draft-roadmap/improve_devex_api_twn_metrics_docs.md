## Risks

| Risk                                                                            | (Accept, Own, Mitigation)                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Define collaboration with BI for metrics                                        | Communicate                                                                                    |
| Browser reliability is a multi-prong problem (js-waku/libp2p, nwaku/nim-libp2p) | Strong collaboration                                                                           |
| No "documentation" expert or dedicated resources                                | outsource help from doc experts in IFT, focus on setting guidelines for all Waku CCs to follow |

### Implement Light Push Error codes in The Browser

**Owner**: js-waku

**Feature**: [Light Push](/FURPS/core/light_push.md)

**FURPS**:
- F4. Supports comprehensive error codes for various failure scenarios.
- U4. Provides descriptive error messages in responses.
- R2. Status codes indicate the best recovery method (retry, discard service node or irrecoverable failure).

For S2. Browser as client
Spec delivery not included.

- [ ] Code: link to GitHub issues/PRs/Epic

### [Introduce Waku API in the Browser](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/283)

**Owner**: js-waku

**Feature**: [Waku SDK](/FURPS/core/waku_sdk.md)

**FURPS**: 
- F1. Setup, start and stop a Waku node.
- F2. Support edge node operation mode.
- F4. Does automatic peer discovery based on the node platform and operation mode.
- F5. Returns health and connectivity information using proven heuristics.
- F6. Previously discovered peers are persisted across restarted, and potentially used for future connections.
- U1. When setting up a Waku node, no need to specify what protocols to mount, only an operational mode (edge or relay).
- U2. Disconnection detection and recovery, and other peer management matters are automatically handled.
- U3. Developers do not need to specify the protocols used to send and receive messages; it is deduced from the mode of operation.
- U4. Developers pass and receive data to the API in types native to the wrapping language.
- U5. By default, auto-sharding is applied, meaning developers do not need to be concerned by sharding; pubsub topics are never exposed.
- U6. Developers only need to handle errors in cases of irretrievable failure requiring end-user action. Internal errors are not bubbled up if they can be recovered internally.
- R1. Sends a message using peer-to-peer reliability (service node redundancy, optional store confirmation)
- R2. Receives messages using peer-to-peer reliability (service node redundancy, periodic store query, periodic filter ping)

For S3. Browser; distribution via npmjs.com.

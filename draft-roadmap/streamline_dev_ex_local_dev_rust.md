# Streamline DevEx: Mobile, Rust and Web dev

**Estimated date of completion**: {Enter date} TODO

**Resources Required for 2025H2**:
- {roles and % application to it}
- {external services consumed (Vac/IFT)}
- {infrastructure}

Complete the Waku API implementation in nwaku by implementing edge node mode (Status' Light Mode).

Streamline the Developer Experience by delivering a Rust SDK that implements the full Waku API and is available on crates.io.
As well as building an easy-to-use local dev environment from the browser, enabling developers to build web apps without
relying on external connectivity; as well as opting in and out of RLN, and include a local RLN dev environment.

Finalize the integration of nwaku in Status application by setting up nwaku-based build for Mobile platforms.

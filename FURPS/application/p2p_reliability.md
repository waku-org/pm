# P2P Reliability

## Functionality

1. Improves probability of message propagation through redundant publishing and receiving.
2. Enables detection and remedy of message losses between peers using Store or Filter based reliability strategies.
3. Enhances Lightpush reliability through service node pooling, redundant publishing, and failure detection.
4. Improves Filter reliability through redundant subscriptions and subscription health monitoring.

## Usability

1. Provides feedback on message delivery status leveraging store protocol.
2. Automatically handles reconnection and retransmission when failures are detected.
